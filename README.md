# Always On Top
Always On Top is a GNOME extension that allows applications that don't have the 'Always On Top' feature in their default menus to stay on top of other windows.

## Features

### Panel Button
A button appears on the top panel that shows the current window state:
- **Left click**: Toggle the focused window's "always on top" status
- **Right click**: Open the context menu for quick settings access
- **Middle click**: Toggle window stickiness (visible on all workspaces) - only works when stickiness is enabled in settings

### Visual Indicators
The panel button shows different icons based on the current window state:
- **Pinned icon**: Window is on top
- **Under icon**: Window is not on top
- **Pinned sticky icon**: Window is on top AND visible on all workspaces
- **Under sticky icon**: Window is visible on all workspaces but not on top
- **No focus icon**: No window is focused or desktop is focused

### Keyboard Shortcut
- **Default shortcut**: `Super+T` to toggle pin/unpin the focused window on top
- **Customizable**: Change the keyboard shortcut through the extension preferences

### Stickiness Feature
When enabled, you can make windows "sticky" (visible on all virtual desktops):
- Use middle-click on the panel button to toggle stickiness
- Can be disabled in settings if not needed
- Works independently of the "always on top" feature

### Configurable Settings
Access settings via the extension preferences or right-click the panel button:
- **Position**: Choose whether the button appears on the left or right side of the panel
- **Rank**: Set the position priority (0-9) among other panel elements
- **Stickiness**: Enable/disable the middle-click stickiness feature
- **Keyboard Shortcut**: Customize the hotkey for toggling always-on-top

## Usage Tips

1. **Quick Toggle**: Use the keyboard shortcut `Super+T` for instant window pinning

4. **Settings Access**: Right-click the panel button for quick access to preferences

## Troubleshooting

### Extension not appearing after installation
- Make sure you restarted GNOME Shell properly
- Check if the extension is enabled: `gnome-extensions list --enabled`
- Verify the extension directory exists and has correct permissions

### Keyboard shortcut not working
- Check if the shortcut conflicts with system shortcuts
- Try setting a different shortcut in the extension preferences
